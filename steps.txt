1. Download SUDO
	-You can check whether SUDO is installed by the command "sudo -V";
	-To download the SUDO, you need to use to command "apt-get install sudo" but to do it, you need to switch to the root user;
	-To switch to the root user, run the command "su -". SU command is used to switch between users: generally you run it in the way "su username" but 
		if username isn't typed, the Linux process it in the way to switch you to the root user (default). However, this can lead to that not all the 
		bash-files are found;

2. Add the user to groups (not root one)
	-Switch to the root user;
	-Run the command "usermod -aG sudo username" to do it. -G option is used to define the group and -a option is used to add the user to the group 
		(used only with -G). After the options the name of the group is determined, and last argument is the username of the user;
	-To check which users are part of the group, the command "getent group groupname";
	-To check to which groups the user is assigned, the command "groups username" must be used;

3. Create a user42 group
	-To create the user groups, you must run the command "groupadd groupname";
	-Follow the step 2 once more to add the user to the user42 group;

4. Change of hostname (for evaluation)
	-If you need to change the hostname temporarily, you can use the command "hostname new_name". After the reboot of the system, the change will be 
		reverted back. To verify the changes, run the command "hostname";
	-If you need to change the hostname permanently, you should use the command "hostnamectl set-hostname new_name". To verify the changes, run the 
		command "hostnamectl" which shows the system information - the hostname is written in line with Static hostname (can be run only if there is 
		a systemd files);

5. Create a new user (for evaluation)
	-To create a new user, you should run the command "userad username";
	-To be able to log in as the new user, you must set up the user's password. It can be achieved by the command "passwd username";
	-On the step of creating user, it can be assigned to the groups with option -G after which you must list the groups to which it should be added, 
		separated by comma;
	-For temporary users, you can use the option -e to set up the expiration date of the user in the format YYYY-MM-DD. For example, 
		"useradd -e 2024-06-30 username";

6. Add the possibility for user to use "sudo" (if the step 2 is done for sudo group, then there is no general need of it)
	-To be able to use "sudo", user must be added to the list of sudoers in suders.tmp file. To open that file, run the command "sudo visudo";
	-Find the line where it is written "# User privilege specification". By default, after that line, only the root user mentioned;
	-Add your user under the root user in the format "username ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL";
	-However, by default there is a possibility to use SUDO for users added to sudo group (see the line "# Allow members of group sudo t execute any command"); 

7. Set up the SSH server (description of SSH read in for_eval.txt)
	-To download the SSH Server, run the command "apt install openssh-server" as a root user or "sudo apt install openssh-server" as a user;
	-To check the SSH service status, use the command "systemctl status ssh". The Active line must conatin value: "active(running)" - the SSH Service 
		is enabled. If the SSH Server isn't active, you must start it with "service ssh start". To stop it, if needed, you can run "service ssh stop" 
		- it will be stopped until next reboot. To turn SSH off indefinitely, use "systemctl disable ssh";
	-To change the port for SSH Server (the default port is 22), open the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config (you can run the command "vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config",
		there will be no need to download vim). Find the line "#Port 22" and replace it with "Port 4242" without hash symbol. Do the same in the file
		/etc/ssh/ssh_config. Additionally, find the line with "PermitRootLogin ..." and set this permission to "no" that it looks like 
		"#PermitRootLogin no". Save the changes in file;
	-To update the port you need to restart the SSH server. To do it, run "service ssh restart". You can run the command "systemctl status ssh" to check
		that the port is changed: in the line with "Server listening on :: ..." there must be the port 4242 instead of 22";
	-To verify the changes of accessing for root user, run this line "ssh root@amelniko42 -p 4242". After entering the password, the output must be
		"Permission denied ...";
	
8. Install and configure Firewall for SSH server
	-To install the firewall UFW, run the command "apt-get install ufw";
	-To activate the firewall, you need to use command "ufw enable". To check the status of the firewall, you can use "ufw status numbered" - the output must be
		"Status: active";
	-To allow SSH access for Firewall via port 4242, run "ufw allow 4242";
	-To see the available streams, use the command "ufw status". There the ports will be listed as well as the level of incoming access. If there are additional
		ports besides 4242, you can remove those rules from the list: for this, run the command "ufw status numbered" to see the numbers of rules, then use
		"ufw delete [number]" specifying the number of rule which needs to be deleted;
	-Best practice is to run additionally the commands for default connections: incoming and outgoing. To set up rules for default connections, run
		"ufw default ... incoming/outgoing" - ... replace with the access rule (deny for incoming and allow for outgoing);

9. Configure the SUDO group with requirements
	-Create a directory for logging actions there, both inputs and outputs - use "su -" to return to the default directory and create a directory /var/log/sudo/;
	-To add local rules for SUDO, we need to create a separate file in /etc/sudoers.d/ directory. Create a file "sudo_config" there - next steps will describe
		changes of that file;
	-To limit authentication using sudo with 3 attempts, add the line "Defaults
