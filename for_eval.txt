1. aptitude and apt
    WHAT IS APT (Advanced Package Tool)
        It's a free and open source software which handles software installation and removal. Initially it was designed by Debian. It's a low-level package manager.
        apt is command line without GUI (Graphical User Interface).
        Whenever it is invoked with the specified name of package to install, it finds the package in configured list of sources specified in "/etc/apt/sources.list"
            along with the list of dependencies for that package and automatically installs those dependencies along with the current package.
    
    WHAT IS APTITUDE
        It is a front-end to to APT which adds UI to the functionality. So it is a higher-level package manager.

    WHAT IS THE DEFFERENCE BETWEEN APT AND APTITUDE
        APTITUDE is vaster in functionality as it includes functionalities of apt-get, apt-mark and apt-cache (apt-get - to install, apt-mark - to mark the package
            in different ways, apt-cache - to interact with installed packages);
        APTITUDE has a text-only and interactive UI;
        APTITUDE has better package management (it can suggest possible measures to solve conflicts, it can show why certain actions are blocked or why an action
            must be taken, etc.)


2. SSH (Secure Shell)
    It is a network communication protocol which provides strong password authentication and public key authentication, as well as encrypted data communications
        between two computers. The communication is encrypted. In addition to providing strong encryption, SSH is widely used by network administrators to manage
        systems and applications remotely, enabling them to log in to another computer over a network, execute commands and move files from one computer to another.
    HOW TO USE SSH?
        The most basic use of SSH is to connect to a remote host for a terminal session.
        By default, port 22 is used to establish an SSH connection. This port is automatically configured during the installation of your operating system.
        To reduce the number of brute force attacks, you can configure another port for SSH access.
        For security reasons, logging into the SSH server directly as the root user should be disabled. This is to prevent unauthorized access to the system 
            with full administrative privileges, which can be risky if the root password is compromised.
    HOW TO CONNECT TO A SERVER USING SSH?

    FIREWALL FOR SSH SERVER
        A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and decides whether to allow or block specific traffic 
            based on a defined set of security rules.
        Configuring the firewall for SSH is an essential step when enabling SSH because it ensures SSH traffic is allowed through the firewall. In some cases,
            firewalls block incoming connections to the system as a security measure. Therefore, to allow SSH connections from other machines, configure the
            firewall to permit SSH traffic.
        Firewall rules are the major components of firewall policies that determine which types of traffic your firewall allows in and out of your network, 
            and which are blocked.
        In the list of available UFW rules for firewall there is a notation (v6) which refers to IPv6 type of addresses; if there is no notation for rule, then
            it it applied for IPv4 addresses. IPv4 addresses are composed of four octets, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by periods (dots). An example of 
            an IPv4 address is "192.168.1.1". IPv6 addresses are composed of eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, separated by colons. An example of an IPv6 
            address is "2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334" - they can often be shortened by omitting leading zeros and by using :: to represent consecutive 
            groups of zeroes.
    CONFIGURATION OF SUDOERS FILE
        The sudoers policy plugin determines a user's sudo privileges.
        In the sudoers file, the keyword Defaults is used to set default configuration options for the sudo command. These options apply globally to all users 
            and groups unless overridden by specific user or group settings. The Defaults keyword allows you to specify various security, logging, and behavioral 
            options for sudo.
