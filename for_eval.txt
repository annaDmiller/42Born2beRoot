1. aptitude and apt
    WHAT IS APT (Advanced Package Tool)
        It's a free and open source software which handles software installation and removal. Initially it was designed by Debian. It's a low-level package manager.
        apt is command line without GUI (Graphical User Interface).
        Whenever it is invoked with the specified name of package to install, it finds the package in configured list of sources specified in "/etc/apt/sources.list"
            along with the list of dependencies for that package and automatically installs those dependencies along with the current package.
    
    WHAT IS APTITUDE
        It is a front-end to to APT which adds UI to the functionality. So it is a higher-level package manager.

    WHAT IS THE DEFFERENCE BETWEEN APT AND APTITUDE
        APTITUDE is vaster in functionality as it includes functionalities of apt-get, apt-mark and apt-cache (apt-get - to install, apt-mark - to mark the package
            in different ways, apt-cache - to interact with installed packages);
        APTITUDE has a text-only and interactive UI;
        APTITUDE has better package management (it can suggest possible measures to solve conflicts, it can show why certain actions are blocked or why an action
            must be taken, etc.)


2. SSH (Secure Shell)
    It is a network communication protocol which provides strong password authentication and public key authentication, as well as encrypted data communications
        between two computers. The communication is encrypted. In addition to providing strong encryption, SSH is widely used by network administrators to manage
        systems and applications remotely, enabling them to log in to another computer over a network, execute commands and move files from one computer to another.
    HOW TO USE SSH?
        The most basic use of SSH is to connect to a remote host for a terminal session.
        By default, port 22 is used to establish an SSH connection. This port is automatically configured during the installation of your operating system.
        To reduce the number of brute force attacks, you can configure another port for SSH access.
